# pong
2D Pong game on Unity.
A 2 player game where you must hit the ball back and forth and use your paddle to block the opponents goals.
So fun, you'll never want it to end! Which is great because there's literally no end to the game.

For my first attempt at a Unity project, i followed along a tutorial to familiarise myself with its interface and features and grasped a better understanding on how the software works.
